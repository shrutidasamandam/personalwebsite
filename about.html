          <h1>Hello! Thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          
          <h2>Some Background Information!</h2>

          <h3>Early Life:</h3>
          <p> I was born and brought up in Connecticut for the initial 14 years of my life. I went to middle and elementary school in Brookfield,
             Connecticut. In Connecticut, I generally realized that the universe of technology was ambiguously there and fiddled with JavaScript
              and Scratch in my free time. 
          </p>

          <h3>High School:</h3>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2017, my family and I moved towards the west coast because of my father's employment. I attended Newport High School in Washington. 
            High School was the point at which my enthusiasm for technology truly caused a huge impact on my world. The universe of technology truly encompassed
             me as Washington is the central point of tech.
          </p>
          <p> 
            In High School, I joined any club and class that surrounded the world of Computer Science. I joined my high school's robotics club and took all
             of the AP Computer Science classes offered at my school. Robotics was a different universe, making a robot and viewing your robot achieve errands such as 
             utilizing a switch to move itself onto a bar intrigued me. During my second year of robotics, I was offered a position as programming lead. This
              influential position implied instructing over a group of 25+ students how to compose robot code and working in C++ and Java. During Robotics, I was mentored 
              by guides who worked in the Tech Industry, such as Google and Microsoft. I additionally had the opportunity to present alongside my group at the Google 
              Headquarters during the Google DevFest in Kirkland, Washington. 
          </p>
         <p>
          During my junior year (around the end of December of 2020), I received a life changing call. Both of my grandparents were determined to have stage 4 
          cancer. My grandparents lived in India, so making the trips between nations became truly exhausting for both of my parents. Around March of 2020, my parents decided on the possibility 
          of moving to India to support my grandparents. This choice altered my whole world, as I just had one more year to graduate, and in 2 years I would be attending a university. Just like life 
          likes to throw random shocks here and there. I discovered that I could graduate in my junior year. I had around 2 months to complete 10 semester of classes to graduate with the impending 
          class of 2020. Everyone around me told me that I was unable to do it and to surrender. Alongside my typical eleventh grade classes, I needed to complete
          all of the twelth grade work simultaneously. This was both intellectually and truly debilitating. However! One week before the class of 2020's graduation, I at last wrapped up and completed. Through 
           thoroughly maintaining productivity, organizing and keeping my goals/tasks in focus, and putting in a lot of hard work. I was able to prove those who did not believe in me that they were in fact 
           incorrect. 
          </p>

          <h3>College</h3>
            <p>
              Now, I am currently enrolled as a freshman at BMS College Of Engineering (BMSCE) pursuing an undergraduate degree. I will be majoring in CSE (Computer Science and Engineering).
               I pursue interests in the Web Development field and Software Engineering field, I am seeking for exciting opportunities related to these career options. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Being an international student, I have repeatedly been exposed to new cultures and diverse groups of people. This has made me been able to quickly adapt changes and gain a broader perspective.
              And has made me ready to rapidly adjust changes and increase a more extensive viewpoint. I am consistently inquisitive about different things and profoundly appreciate learning. I am a 
              detail orientated individual and keep my objectives coordinated to maintain productivity. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that the skills I have attained from the dynamic environment, the struggles I have faced at a young age, and the competitive university atmosphere defines me and I am 
              looking forward to implementing & polishing them in any opportunity that I receive.
