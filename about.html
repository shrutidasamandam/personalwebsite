          <h2>Some Background Information!</h2>

          <h3>Early Life:</h3>
          <p> I was born and brought up in Connecticut for the initial 14 years of my life. I went to middle and elementary school in Brookfield,
             Connecticut. In Connecticut, I generally realized that the universe of technology was ambiguously there and fiddled with JavaScript
              and Scratch in my free time. 
          </p>

          <h3>High School:</h3>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2017, my family and I moved towards the west coast because of my father's employment. I attended Newport High School in Washington. 
            High School was the point at which my enthusiasm for technology truly caused a huge impact on my world. The universe of technology truly encompassed
             me as Washington is the central point of tech.
          </p>
          <p> 
            In High School, I joined any club and class that surrounded the world of Computer Science. During my Sophmore year of high school, I was introduced to the 
            world of FIRST robotics, FIRST is a global robotics competition that inspires students of all ages to discover STEM. In competition, students are pushed to 
            think strategically and apply engineering and computer science skills to build a robot. Beyond competition, FIRST also provides students the opportunity to 
            help their community through educating students about STEM. Through this unique program, students not only gain valuable technical skills, but also build 
            leadership and cooperation skills key to their careers. I joined my high school's robotics club and took all of the AP Computer Science classes offered at my 
            school. During my second year of robotics, I was offered a position as programming lead. This influential position implied instructing over a group of 25+ 
            students how to compose robot code and working in C++ and Java. During Robotics, I had the opportunity to be mentored by guides who worked in the Tech 
            Industry, such as Google and Microsoft. I additionally had the privellege to present alongside my group at the Google Headquarters during the Google DevFest 
            in Kirkland, Washington. 
          </p>

          <h3>College</h3>
            <p>
              Now, I am currently enrolled as a freshman at BMS College Of Engineering (BMSCE) pursuing an undergraduate degree. I will be majoring in CSE (Computer Science and Engineering).
               I pursue interests in the Web Development field and Software Engineering field, I am seeking for exciting opportunities related to these career options. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Being an international student, I have repeatedly been exposed to new cultures and diverse groups of people. This has made me been able to quickly adapt changes and gain a broader perspective.
              And has made me ready to rapidly adjust changes and increase a more extensive viewpoint. I am consistently inquisitive about different things and profoundly appreciate learning. I am a 
              detail orientated individual and keep my objectives coordinated to maintain productivity. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that the skills I have attained from the dynamic environment, the struggles I have faced at a young age, and the competitive university atmosphere defines me and I am 
              looking forward to implementing & polishing them in any opportunity that I receive.
